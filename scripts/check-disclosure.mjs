/**
 * Publication gate: keep internal implementation detail off the public site.
 *
 * What we publish is the Guild itself and the two systems meant for an outside
 * audience. Which internal system owns which capability, how the estate is
 * organised, and where the private design documents live are all internal
 * matters — none of it belongs on a site customers and press read.
 *
 * Scans the FULL file including code blocks and JSON payloads: an internal
 * identifier pasted into a sample document discloses just as much as one
 * written in prose.
 *
 * The word list is calibrated for THIS site and deliberately differs from the
 * one used by the product documentation site. A brand site's vocabulary is not
 * a technical writer's: "projection" here means the geometric kind, and one of
 * the marks is built on exactly that idea. Banning it would misfire on the
 * brand story itself.
 *
 * This file is excluded from publication via _config.yml — it necessarily
 * contains every term it forbids.
 *
 * Escape hatch: append a same-line comment `disclosure-ok: <reason>` when a
 * term genuinely must appear. Use sparingly — the reason is reviewed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-disclosure.mjs [dir]
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 = clean
 *   1 = disclosure found
 *   2 = runtime error
